# VANETs-Project

## Description 

This project was created as the implementation of my Master's Thesis @ NTUA ECE 2023, with the title:
"Simulation of Content Distribution Policies in Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) with the use of Machine Learning Algorithms".
The code is written in C++ and Python and is built using OMNET++, Veins and SUMO.

## Installation

The prerequisites for running this code are:
- OMNET++ 5.6.2
- Veins 5.2
- Sumo 1.8.0

Once these are installed, copy the contents of the repository into the folder in which you installed Veins and build the project using OMNET++.
